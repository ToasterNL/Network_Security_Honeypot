\section{Introduction}
In this paper we will try to present an overview of the data we have collected from the honeypot and explain the different attacks that were waged against it. 
In the second section we will describe the changes we have made to the setup during the "Waiting for hackers" phase. 
The third section will present an overview of various statistics we have collected from the logfiles, e.g. number of IP-addresses, countries and attack types. 
In the fourth section we will discuss which attacks took place against the different services the honeypot was running e.g. SSH and MySQL.
In order to discover the sophisticationof the attacks, we will try to present possible connections between an attack on one service and an attack on a different service, in the fifth section.
The sixth section will conclude our findings. 
Finally we will discuss this project and provide some improvements. 




\section{Setup}
\label{Setup}

On the 1st of November we delivered our initial setup document, however during the "Waiting for hackers" phase we have made adjustments to the setup in order to attract more activity to the honeypot. In this section we will discuss the changes that were made.


\section{Statistics}
\label{Statistics}
In this section we will discuss the statistical data that have been gathered from our logfiles. 






\section{Attacks on the different services}
\label{Attacks}
During phase 2 we have monitored the honeypot closely and collected data about different attacks against the honeypot. In this section we will discuss the attacks against the services the honeypot was running.



\section{Connection between the attacks}
\label{Connection}
In this section we will correlate the data about attacks against one service against the data of attacks of a different service. We will try to look for a pattern or similarities in this data and determine if the attack was more sophisticated.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}
From Section \ref{Connection} we can conclude that...



\section{Discussion}
\label{Discussion}
In this section we would like to discuss some issues we encountered during the honeypotproject. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Low/High interaction phase
\item GHH
\item etc
\end{itemize}
